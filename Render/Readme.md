#### How the scene was setup
I made the trunk of two trees with the shape of cube and used a modifier named 'skin'. I made the trunk for the third tree with the shape of cylinder and adjusted according to how I wanted. To make it look like low poly, I used a modifier named 'decimate' and decreased the ratio.

### Floating Island with Mountains and Water
### Reference

#### How the scene was setup
I made the island with mountains using the shape 'icosphere' with 3 subdivisions and scaled it accordingly. For the water, I used the shape 'plane', adjusted it and made the water look glossy by adding a shader, transparent shader and glossy BSDF in the shader editor.

### Pirate Ship
### Reference
#### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFeWNR33b_A&list=PLob6hbUtmU2PLtPpgVO0sKNBuBwP0tQ-z&index=1

#### How the scene was set up
The object was made from a cube that was extended from both sides and bent in the middle to get the boat shape. Then after using various options like S, G, K, R, I was able to get the base of the ship done.

The poles with the sailing masts was done using 2 cylinders and 4 planes that were further edited upon to look like the ship is sailing forward..

I positioned the camera to capture the ship from a side angle and used a pointing light positioned in the left side to get the shadow and colors of the ship after adding different material colors to perfect the model.

### Flag Pole

### How the scene was set up
The flag pole was done using a cylinder which was adjusted using S and G and then a sphere was added on the top to make it more like a pole.
The Flag part was done using a plane on which the edge i scaled and reduced to make it like a trianglular flag.
Then furthermore i added material colors like red, black and beige to make it perfect and match the theme.

### Render Output

### Clouds

### How the scene was set up
The clouds were done using a ico-sphere. I edited the sphere in skulpt mode to reshape and extended it. To make it more cloud looking i added curves and smoothened up the edges and add a material white color as well.
